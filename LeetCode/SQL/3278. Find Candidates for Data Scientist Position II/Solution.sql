-- Table: Candidates

-- +--------------+---------+ 
-- | Column Name  | Type    | 
-- +--------------+---------+ 
-- | candidate_id | int     | 
-- | skill        | varchar |
-- | proficiency  | int     |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- (candidate_id, skill) is the unique key for this table.
-- Each row includes candidate_id, skill, and proficiency level (1-5).
-- Table: Projects

-- +--------------+---------+ 
-- | Column Name  | Type    | 
-- +--------------+---------+ 
-- | project_id   | int     | 
-- | skill        | varchar |
-- | importance   | int     |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- (project_id, skill) is the primary key for this table.
-- Each row includes project_id, required skill, and its importance (1-5) for the project.
-- Leetcode is staffing for multiple data science projects. Write a solution to find the best candidate for each project based on the following criteria:

-- Candidates must have all the skills required for a project.
-- Calculate a score for each candidate-project pair as follows:
-- Start with 100 points
-- Add 10 points for each skill where proficiency > importance
-- Subtract 5 points for each skill where proficiency < importance
-- If the candidate's skill proficiency equal to the project's skill importance, the score remains unchanged
-- Include only the top candidate (highest score) for each project. If thereâ€™s a tie, choose the candidate with the lower candidate_id. If there is no suitable candidate for a project, do not return that project.

-- Return a result table ordered by project_id in ascending order.

-- The result format is in the following example.
